## Ravenous

https://steliannechita.github.io/ravenous/

Ravenous is a web application that acts as a Yelp.com clone, where users can search for restaurants in a specific area, by using one of the available filters. The result will be a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API.
This web app is the capstone project of React course on the Codecademy platform

### Challenges

The most challenging thing was to build the search bar, particullarly the sorting filters, where I also needed to build a method to change the style of the UI of selected filter when user clicks on it.

### Personal contributions/ enhancements

Aside from the project's standard requirements , I've personally added a display message to UI for situations where request from the API is throwing an error (e.g. invalid search inputs or no internet connection). Also properly sorted results by Rating, as the API's own filter for this partricular criteria , is broken. Fetched and displayed additional information to UI (e.g. tel number for each of the results )

### Future features

- Rendering a map to the UI which will display the location for the results listed
- Add more searching criteria
